    <h2>Despre <em>Beagle</em></h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>beagle</strong> is a breed of small scent hound, similar in
      appearance to the much larger foxhound. The beagle was developed primarily
      for hunting hare, known as beagling

    <h2>Curiozitati:</h2>

      <li>
        Alongside the Bloodhound and Basset Hound, the beagle has one of the
        best developed senses of smell of any dog.[31] In the 1950s, John Paul
        Scott and John Fuller began a 13-year study of canine behavior. As part
        of this research, they tested the scenting abilities of various breeds
        by putting a mouse in a one-acre field and timing how long it took the
        dogs to find it. The beagles found it in less than a minute while Fox
        Terriers took 15 minutes and Scottish Terriers failed to find it at
        all.[31] The long ears and large lips of the beagle probably assist in
        trapping the scents close to the nose.

        The average size of a beagle litter is six puppies. When mother beagles
        give birth to litters of puppies, the little pups weigh just a few
        ounces each.[
      </li>
      <li>
        The typical longevity of beagles is 12â€“15 years,[43] which is a common
        lifespan for dogs of their size.
